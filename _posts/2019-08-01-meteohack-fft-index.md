lead_text: "The effects of unchecked climate change - flash flooding. See our submission for team <b>GeoHack</b> to Environment Canada and Hackworks' MeteoHack <b>hackathon.</b><br>
<p><b>Winner</b> in the Warning! Danger Ahead! category - analyze Earth science and weather data to monitor natural disasters, and impact on life and property.</p>
<p>My personal contribution was detecting floods using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)) and a risk model index. The FFT index is divided into low, medium, and high risk categories.</p>"
