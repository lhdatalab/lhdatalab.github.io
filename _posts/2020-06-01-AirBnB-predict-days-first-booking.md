lead_text: 'Estimate opportunity for AirBnB to increase US revenue during (post) downward economic trend (first 6 months of 2020).
On average new users take 3 weeks (US) and 1 month (Global) before making a booking.
As a result AirBnB can increase revenue by $1 billion (from $3.8B) by increasing customer conversion rates from 50% to 65% (US only). See Readme.md (at the GitHub link below) for a more complete summary.'
