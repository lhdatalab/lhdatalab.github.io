lead_text: 'Fatal and serious injury collisions occur in only 1.4% of accidents. The main challenge was building a model that predicts these accident types based on lighting, road, weather, junction, DUI (driving under the influence) etc. conditions. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and a support vector machine classifier gave an f1-score of 0.998.'
