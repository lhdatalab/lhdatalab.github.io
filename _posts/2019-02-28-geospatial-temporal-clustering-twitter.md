lead_text: 'Based on the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014; can clustering extract "unusual" local knowledge (positive sentiment) from global social injustice text (overwhelming negative sentiment)?

Yes, geolocation and time-based grouping of short text (data) in New York City gives e.g. overall sentiment = +0.15 for organising protests and rallies, but -0.1 for political reaction to the incident. Contrast this with cities outside of NYC where rallies also have a +0.15 sentiment, but legal/political reaction = +0.1 and injustice theme = -0.05.
